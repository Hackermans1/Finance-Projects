# Finance-bank_teller
A system that emulates the transactions that are carried out by either a bank teller or an ATM machine.
I did this project on codecademy site. It was implemented the following five features:

Return the balance that the customer has in the bank
Allow the customer to make a deposit to their bank account
Allow the customer to make a withdrawal to their bank account
Allow the customer to decide whether to make the transaction with checking or savings account
Allow the customer to make a transfer between savings and checking account
